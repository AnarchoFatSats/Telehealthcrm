## üö® Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-5 minutes)

#### Detection Sources
1. **Automated Alerts**: CloudWatch alarms, PagerDuty
2. **User Reports**: Support tickets, user complaints
3. **Monitoring Dashboards**: Real-time metrics
4. **Health Checks**: Automated health check failures

#### Initial Response Actions
1. **Acknowledge Alert**: Respond to PagerDuty alert
2. **Assess Severity**: Determine incident severity level
3. **Create Incident Channel**: Create dedicated Slack channel
4. **Notify Stakeholders**: Alert relevant team members
5. **Begin Investigation**: Start gathering information

#### Communication Template
```
