## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (24-48 Hours)

### **Step 1: AWS Infrastructure Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd deployment-production-20250923_214445

# Set up AWS infrastructure
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var="environment=production" -out=tfplan_production

# ⚠️ MANUAL APPROVAL REQUIRED
# Review the terraform plan, then apply:
terraform apply tfplan_production
```

**This will create:**
- ✅ VPC with private/public subnets
- ✅ DynamoDB tables (schedules, appointments)
- ✅ S3 buckets with encryption and versioning
- ✅ CloudFront distribution for CDN
- ✅ KMS keys for encryption
- ✅ Security groups and network configuration

### **Step 2: Database Setup**
```bash
# After AWS RDS is created, run migrations:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f packages/db/migrations/20240101000000_update_user_roles.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f packages/db/migrations/20250916_add_signature_events.sql
```

### **Step 3: Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Set these in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:
NODE_ENV=production
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
DYNAMODB_SCHEDULE_TABLE=telehealth-schedules-production
S3_RX_PAD_BUCKET=telehealth-rx-pads-production
OTEL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=https://your-collector-endpoint
```

### **Step 4: Application Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy backend to ECS Fargate
# Deploy frontend to AWS Amplify
# Configure load balancers and auto-scaling
# Set up health checks and monitoring
```
